Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Josh,

I am writing to you from a colossal spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a orange rocket in May. There are 42 racecars and flowers of fountain here! In the
billiard room there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a soft bed of
gelfoam and dream of sleeping nicely. It feels as though I have lived here for
three [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
