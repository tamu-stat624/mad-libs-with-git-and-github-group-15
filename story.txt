Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Josh,

I am writing to you from a colossal spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a orange rocket in May. There are 42 racecars and flowers of fountain here! In the
billiard room there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] hours. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is to
fly on a fast helicopter!!

Best wishes,
Ariana
